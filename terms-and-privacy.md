### 1. Information We Collect

- Your IP address (we have configured Sentry to scrub/block IP addresses)
- Your name, email, or any personal identifiers
- Your videos, photos, or any media content
- Your location (GPS or otherwise)
- Any content you create within the App

**Legal basis for processing (GDPR):** Legitimate interest in maintaining and improving app stability.

 If you contact us by email, we receive your email address and any information you include in your message. We use this only to respond to you and provide support.

### 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Double You is designed to protect your privacy. We want to be explicitly clear about what we do NOT collect:

- **Videos and Photos:** All video recording, editing, masking, and exporting happens entirely on your device. Your videos never leave your phone unless you choose to share them yourself.
- **Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personal identifiers through the App.

- **Biometric Data:** We do not collect fingerprints, face scans, or any biometric information.
- **Health or Fitness Data:** We do not collect any health-related information.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

The limited diagnostic information we collect through Sentry is used solely for:

- **Bug Fixing:** Identifying and resolving crashes and errors
- **App Improvement:** Understanding app stability issues to improve user experience
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring the App works correctly across different devices and operating systems

We do NOT use your information for:

- Advertising or marketing
- Selling to third parties
- Creating user profiles
- Tracking your behavior
- Any purpose other than improving app stability

### 4. Third-Party Services

#### Sentry (Error Monitoring)

We use Sentry to collect crash reports and diagnostic data. Sentry is a reputable third-party service with strong privacy practices.

- **Provider:** Functional Software, Inc. (Sentry)
- **Privacy Policy:**[https://sentry.io/privacy/](https://sentry.io/privacy/)
- **Data Processing Agreement:** We have a data processing agreement with Sentry that complies with GDPR requirements
- **IP Address Handling:** We have configured Sentry to NOT collect or store user IP addresses

#### App Store / Google Play

 When you purchase and download the App, Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store) may collect information according to their own privacy policies. This data collection is governed by: 

- **Apple:**[https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- **Google:**[https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

We do not have access to your payment information or Apple/Google account details.

#### Camera and Storage Access

The App requires access to your device's camera and storage to function. This access is used solely to:

- Record video using your device's camera
- Save exported videos to your device's photo library/gallery
- Access previously recorded videos for editing

**All camera and storage operations happen locally on your device.** We do not transmit, upload, or access this content remotely.

### 5. Data Storage and Security

#### On-Device Processing

 All video recording, editing, compositing, and exporting happens entirely on your device. Your creative content never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it through your device's native sharing features.

#### Crash Data Storage (Sentry)

 Crash reports and diagnostic data are sent to and stored by Sentry in the **European Union (EU)**. We have configured Sentry to scrub/block IP addresses and we do not intentionally send personal data or content to Sentry.

#### Security Measures

 We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect the limited information we process. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 6. Data Retention

 We do not store your videos, photos, or edited content on our servers. Your content remains on your device unless you choose to share it.

 Crash reports and diagnostic data sent to Sentry are retained for up to **30 days**, after which they are deleted or anonymized by Sentry.

### 7. Children's Privacy

 The App is not intended for children under 13 years old (or under 16 in the European Economic Area). We do not target children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will delete it.

### 8. Your Privacy Rights

 Because we collect very limited information, some privacy rights may not apply in practice. We will honor applicable requests as required by law.

#### European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland

 You may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your personal information, and to data portability. You may also withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

#### United States (State Privacy Laws)

 Depending on your state of residence, you may have rights to access, delete, and correct personal information and to opt out of certain processing. **We do not sell or share personal information**, and we do not use personal data for targeted advertising or profiling.

### 9. International Data Transfers

 Our company is based in Romania (EU). Crash report data collected via Sentry is processed and stored in the EU. If you access the App from outside the EU, your crash report data may be processed in the EU. Apple and Google may process payment-related data under their own privacy policies.
