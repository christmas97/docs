## Overview

Sunset Forecast ("the App") predicts the beauty and quality of upcoming sunrises and sunsets. This privacy policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.

## Data Collection

### Data Processed On-Device

- **City search queries**: When you search for a city, your query is sent to the Google Places API to return location suggestions. The App does not store your search history.
- **Weather data**: The App fetches weather data from the Open-Meteo API based on the geographic coordinates of your selected city. This data is used solely to compute forecast scores and is not stored permanently.

### Data We Do NOT Collect
