**Do we process any sensitive personal information?** Some of the information may be considered "special" or "sensitive" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. We do not process sensitive personal information.

**Do we collect any information from third parties?** We do not collect information from third parties beyond the external APIs we call to provide the service and our crash reporting provider.

**Do we use cookies, ads, or Google Analytics?** No. We do not use cookies or third-party advertising, and we do not use Google Analytics.

**Do we use crash reporting?** Yes. We use Sentry for crash reporting and diagnostics (see details below).

**How do we keep your information safe?** We have adequate organizational and technical processes and procedures in place to protect your personal information. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

**Notification of Breaches:** In the event of a security breach that may pose a risk to your rights and freedoms under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are committed to notifying affected users and relevant supervisory authorities without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will communicate the breach directly to you using the contact details you have provided to us. However, this communication may not occur if technical measures were in place to render your personal data unintelligible, such as encryption.

**What are your rights?** Depending on where you are located geographically, the applicable privacy law may mean you have certain rights regarding your personal information.

**How do you exercise your rights?** The easiest way to exercise your rights is by visiting email at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com), or by contacting us. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

### Personal information you disclose to us

*In Short:* We do not collect personal information through the app.

We do not operate a server that receives or stores user data. The app runs on your device. If you contact us directly by email, we will receive the information you choose to include in that email and use it only to respond.

**Sensitive Information.** We do not process sensitive information.

**Payment Data.** Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store). We do not receive your payment details. Any payment data you provide is handled by Apple or Google in accordance with their privacy policies.

### Information automatically collected

*In Short:* We do not collect automatic usage or device data on our servers.

The app does not send usage, device, or location data to our servers because we do not operate servers for the app. We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies, and we do not serve ads.

The only automated data flows are:

- **Crash and Diagnostics Data (Sentry).** We use Sentry to collect crash reports and diagnostic data to improve app stability. This data is processed by Sentry under their privacy policy.
- **Weather API Requests.** If you enable location on your device, the app uses that location locally to make weather API requests. We do not receive, read, or store your location.

Apple/Google: Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store) under their respective terms and privacy policies.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

*In Short:* We do not process or store personal information on our servers. Any processing happens on your device, or by third-party providers that help the app function and improve stability.

We process information only in these limited ways:

- **To deliver the app’s functionality.** Weather data is fetched from third-party APIs directly from your device.
- **To improve stability.** Sentry processes crash and diagnostics data.
- **To respond to you.** If you contact us by email, we use your message to reply.

## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

*In Short:* We do not process or store personal information on our servers. If you contact us by email, we rely on our legitimate interests to respond. If applicable law requires consent for any processing, we will obtain it.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this means we rely on:

- **Legitimate Interests.** To respond to inquiries you send us directly (for example, by email).
- **Consent (when required).** If we need to process information for any other purpose that requires consent under applicable law.

## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

*In Short:* We only share data with providers that power app functionality and diagnostics.

The app uses the following third-party services:

- **Weather API providers.** Requests are made from your device to fetch weather data.
- **Sentry.** Used for crash reporting and diagnostics.
- **Apple App Store / Google Play.** If you purchase a subscription, payment processing is handled by Apple or Google.

We do not share personal information with advertisers, data brokers, or analytics platforms.

## 6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

*In Short:* We do not operate servers that store personal information. Third-party providers we use may process data in other countries.

The app communicates directly with third-party services (such as weather API providers and Sentry). Those providers may process data in countries outside your own, under their respective privacy policies and safeguards.

## 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

*In Short:* We do not store your personal information on our servers.

The app runs on your device and does not send personal information to our servers. Any retention is governed by the third-party services you use through the app, such as Sentry for crash reports and the weather API providers.

## 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

*In Short:* We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

*In Short:* We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com).

## 10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

*In Short:* Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section [HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact) below.

Because we do not collect or store personal information on our servers, we may have no data to provide, correct, or delete. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your [Member State data protection authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en) or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section [HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact) below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section [HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact) below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of the Services, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com).

## 11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

## 12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

*In Short:* Depending on your state, you may have privacy rights. Because we do not collect or store personal information on our servers, there may be no data for us to provide or delete.

If you want to make a request, you can contact us at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com). We do not sell or share personal information, and we do not use personal information for targeted advertising.

## 13. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

*In Short:* If you are in the EEA, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, or other regions, you may have privacy rights under local law. Because we do not collect or store personal information on our servers, there may be no data for us to provide, correct, or delete.

You can contact us at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com) with any privacy questions or requests.

## 14. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

*In Short:* Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

## 15. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?

## Completeness of Privacy Notice

We have made every effort to ensure this Privacy Policy fully explains our data practices and your rights. If any information or disclosure is unintentionally missing, please understand that this is not deliberate. We are committed to promptly addressing any omissions or clarifications needed to comply with applicable data protection laws.

# TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Last updated November 11, 2024

## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

We are **CHRISTMAS SERVICES SRL** ("Company," "we," "us," "our").

We provide the Sunset Score mobile app for iOS and Android (the "App"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

### Description of Sunset Score and Its Services

Sunset Score is a mobile app dedicated to helping users anticipate the beauty of upcoming sunrises and sunsets in their chosen location. By entering a city, users can receive a tailored forecast indicating how visually striking the sunrises and sunsets are expected to be in the coming days. Our forecasts are designed for sunrise and sunset enthusiasts, photographers, and anyone interested in planning their day around these natural events.

**Product and Features** Sunset Score allows users to conveniently search for and access sunrise and sunset forecasts for any city they wish to explore. No account or login is required. The app is designed to be accessible and user-friendly. As our service evolves, we plan to introduce optional client-side notifications, configurable in the app, that alert users when high beauty-score sunrises or sunsets are forecast based on their preferences. These notifications will allow subscribers to stay informed and capture these memorable moments wherever they are.

**Disclaimer on Forecast Accuracy** While Sunset Score aims to provide the most accurate beauty forecasts possible, the natural variability and complexity of weather and atmospheric conditions mean that these predictions are not guaranteed. We use various environmental factors and models to estimate the beauty of sunrises and sunsets, but we cannot account for every change in weather patterns or local conditions. As a result, users should view these forecasts as guidance rather than guaranteed outcomes.

You can contact us by email at [info@sunset-score.com](mailto:info@sunset-score.com)

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

The Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Services.
